HOW TO SHARE A FOLDER TO A KVM VIRTUAL MACHINE GUEST ON VIRT-MANAGER:

Information from https://ostechnix.com/setup-a-shared-folder-between-kvm-host-and-guest/

1. Open Machine and go to 'information' tab

2. Click on 'Add Hardware'

3. Click on 'Filesystem'

4. Select 'virtio-9p' driver

5. Select source path (folder that you want to share)

6. Select target path (name of path that will be mounted to Guest file system) Example: /shared

7. Add full permissions to source path if necessary
    sudo chmod 777 /path/to/folder

8. Load Virtual Machine guest

9. Make a directory where your shared folder will be mounted. Example: mkdir ~/fileshare

10. Open your /etc/fstab as root, and add the following to the end of the file:

/TARGET_PATH /PATH-TO_MOUNT_TO   9p   trans=virtio,version=9p2000,L,rw,_netdev 0 0

Save file and reboot the Guest machine

11. Add a file to the folder you are sharing (if empty), then check to make sure you see the file in the file manager on the guest machine

You're done! Hopefully. If something went wrong, double check your steps. Or, possibly, something changed that makes these instructions not valid anymore.
